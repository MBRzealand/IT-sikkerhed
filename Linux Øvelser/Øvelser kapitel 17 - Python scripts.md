Build the SSH banner-grabbing tool from Listing 17-5 and then edit it to do
a banner grab on port 21.

Edit your ```tcp_server.py``` to prompt the user for the port to listen on.

Build the FTPcracker in Listing 17-7 and then edit it to use a wordlist for
user variable (similar what we did with the password) rather than prompt-
